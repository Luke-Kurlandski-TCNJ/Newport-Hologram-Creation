    "Guide to Python in McGee Laser Lab\n",

    "By Luke Kurlandski, November 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic guide to Python. This guide is written with the assumption that the reader has an understanding of extremely basic programming concept such as basic data types, loops, arrays, and functions. Having knowledge of these concepts in any programming language will prepare you to understand this guide. After reading this guide, you be able to understand the code that has already been written in the McGee Lab. Using this guide, code previously written, and ofcourse the internet, you should be able to write high quality programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing code in McGee Lab, you must consider a few key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Your code needs to be readable and understandable to people other than yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Your code needs to be expandable and easy to build off.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Your code needs to pythonic. Follow the Zen of Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to write code with correct style and conventions. Spend extra time to make your code high quality. Not only is this nessecary for the people following in your footsteps, but it will also benefit you yourself later on. If the code is shit, then fix it.\n",

    "This guide will not cover Tkinter. The graphical user interface aspect is way outside of the scope of this guide. If you need to write programs with a GUI, be prepared for a serious learning curve and time investment. I highly reccomend this site as a source for all things Tkinter. \n",

    "The first concept I will cover is object oriented programming. Classes and objects. Using classes keeps code reusable, organized, and expandable. A class is like a blueprint; an object is the instantiation of a class, like a house in this analagy. Using one blueprint (class) you can create many houses (objects). By modifying the blueprint, you modify how each house will appear when you build it. Classes have data (variables) and behavior (methods).\n",

    "Programmers use a strategy called inheritence to make their lives easier. Inheritence reduces the amount of code needed and increases organization. In an inheritence relationship between two classes, one class is called the 'parent' and one class the 'child'. The child class inherits all of the data and behavior of the parent class, that is, the child class can use the variables and methods defined in the parent class! Inheritence uses an 'X is a Y' relationship. If X is a Y, then class X should inherit from class Y.\n",

    "The next strategy is using files. Accessing files effectivly allows a programmer to store data. It also gives the programmer the power to put a large chunk of text in one convieniant location that is not in the program itself, like a 'Help' guide. Python provides extremely easy use of files compared to other languages (all fingers pointing at C/C++). It is import that the computer knows where to find your files. The computer will search in the local directory by default. If the file is not found, an exception will be thrown. If you do not have the myText.txt file in the same directory as this file, the code below will not execute."
