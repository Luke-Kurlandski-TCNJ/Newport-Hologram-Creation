This information specificaly concerns the Image Selection.

Select an Image:
	Press this button to open up a file explorer to select an image for printing.
	This program functions properly with .png and .jpeg images.
	More image types likely work as well, but this has not been tested rigorously.

Desired Horizontal Gratings:
	Enter how many grating should appear on the image in the horizontal direction.
	The image will be downsized to this many pixels in the horizontal direction.
	If left blank, the program will use the original size of image.

Desired Vertical Gratings:
	Enter how many grating should appear on the image in the vertical direction.
	The image will be downsized to this many pixels in the vertical direction.
	If left blank, the program will use the original size of image.

Cropping:
	Enter how the image should be cropped in addition to downsized.
	Use the form: '(x1,y1),(x2,y2)'
	The program will only print the image within these coordinates: (x1,y1),(x1,y2),(x2,y1),(x2,y2).
	This function is useful if the user needs to only print a portion of the image.
