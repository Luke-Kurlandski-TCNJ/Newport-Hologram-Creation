This information specificaly concerns the Exposure Information.
Keep in mind that grey scale values are indexed from 0-255, inclusively.

Exposure Details
	Enter a mapping of how long the shutter should remain open for various pixel values.
	Formats:
		[{start range},{end range}]:{open time}
		[{start range},{end range}]:{multiplier}x
	Notes:
		{} - inicate where to insert a value
		start range - value included in range
		end range - value will not be included
		open time - how many seconds the shutter should remain open
			{multiplier}x - allows a linear mapping of pixel value to exposure time
	Example I:
		[0,10]:5
		[10,20]:3
		[20,256]:1
		Expose pixels in the range of 0-10, including 0 but excluding 10, for 5 seconds.
 		Expose pixels in the range of 10-20, including 10 but excluding 20, for 3 seconds.
		Expose pixels in the range of 20-256, including 20 but excluding 256, for 1 seconds.
	Example II:
		[0,10]:2.5
		[10,200]:.01x
		[200,256]:.02x
		Expose pixels in the range of 0-10, including 0 but excluding 10, for 2.5 seconds.
 		Expose pixels in the range of 10-200, including 10 but excluding 200, for .01 times the pixel value seconds.
		Expose pixels in the range of 200-256, including 200 but excluding 256, for .02 times the pixel value seconds.

Ignore Details
	Describe which pixel values should not be exposed.
	Overrides the mapping above, in Exposure Details.
	This is optional input.
	Format: 
		[{start range},{end range}]
	Notes:
		{} - inicate where to insert a value
		start range - value included in range
		end range - value will not be included
	Example:
		[0,0]
		[10,20]
		[255,255]
		Do not expose any pixel with a value of 0.
		Do not expose any pixels in the range of 10-20, including 10 but excluding 20.

Laser Details:
	Enter a mapping of what power the laser should use for various pixel values.
	Format/Examples: identical to Exposure Details
	Notes:
		At the time this was written, the laser is shit, and this function is severely limited by the equipment.
		The laser will take several settings to change power; see Equipment Settings to set the pause period.
		Do not include a value in this input that will go over the maximum laser power.
