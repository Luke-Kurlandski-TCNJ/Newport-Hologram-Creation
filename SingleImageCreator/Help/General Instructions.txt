In general, to create a hologram, you should perform the following tasks.

Physical Setup

1) Set "home" position on the motor. Turn motor on and manually move all axes to 0. Turn the motor off. 
2) Turn on motor. Turn the motor back on. Now it does not matter how you move the motor because home is set to 0.
3) Turn on shutter. It is not required to click the "enable shutter" option on the device.
4) Put the hologram into the cradle.

Program Setup

1) Film Information:
Enter how large the image should appear on the hologram.
Optionally include an estimation of how large each grating will appear. 

2) Image Selection:
Select the button to choose what image to print from file explorer.
Enter in how many grating should be present in the final image, ie, how the image should be downsized.
Enter how you wish to crop the image.

3) Exposure Information 
Enter how long a certain pixel value should be exposed.
Enter which pixel values should be ignored.
Enter what power the laser should use to expose certain pixel value.

4) Machinery Settings
Using the menu bar, enter in the correct serial port details for the shutter, motor, and laser.
Using the menu bar, enter in the correct machinery setting for the shutter, motor, and laser.

5) Initialize Experiment
Select the button to update the experiment information and process the data you input.
Select the button to run the experiment.

6) While Running
The listbox offers three options which may be altered at any point during the experiment:
	Run: when selected, the experiment will run.
	Pause: when selected, the experiment will pause until the user selects run or abort.
	Abort: when selected, will cancel the experiment entirely.
An estimation of when the program will complete is produced.
While running, the program will provide information about which pixel is being exposed and what parameters are being used.
